MiraPay Test Account
#A test account is available. Enter the following information into the admin payments settings screen. You will need to setup a proper merchant account with Mirapay to actually use the system for collecting your own payments, but to test the module the test account works well enough. MiraPay has the advantage over PayPal of not requiring the customer to have an account on their system.

PayPal Merchant Account Setup
See the details for setting up a PayPal account at:
http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_merchant-outside

The ATutor Payments module can be run with PayPal "Buy Now Buttons" which allows customers to purchase one item at a time, in the case of ATutor, a single course at a time. Note that payees will have to setup their own PayPal customer account before they can make payments through PayPal. Also note that after a payment is made through PayPal, there is a 10 second delay before the payee is redirected back to ATutor, and the payments table updated with the transaction ID from PayPal. If a users decides to go off to some other web site before being redirected back to ATutor, the payments table may not be updated. In such a case the admin, or the instructor of a course if instructors are given payment management privileges, will need to manually update the payments table, and if auto enroll is turned on, also update the enrolment for the course, manually enrolling the person in the course.  This problem is less likely to occur when using other payment gateways, which automatically redirect back to ATutor without any delay during which the users can go off somewhere else on the Internet.

Once you have your paypal account setup, enter the URL to the PayPal Credit Card processing in the Payments>Settings screen, followed by the Vendor ID, which is the email address associated with the vendor account (leave the password field empty)

PayPal Location
(for production)
https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr

(for testing)

PayPal IPN Setup
For security purpose Instant Payment Notification (IPN) must be setup with your PayPal merchant account. You will be asked to provide a URL to the IPN notification verification script, included with the EComm module. While logged into your PayPal account, select the Profile tab, then choose "Instant Payment Notification Preferences". Turn "ON" the service, and provide the URL. The URL should also include the password you entered when setting up the module Settings in ATutor. The URL would look something like this:

https://www.beanstream.com/public/index.asp

1. Once your Beanstream account is setup, in the administrator's Settings area of the Payments module enter the beanstream credit card processing location. This location is the same for your production system and sandbox.

--------------------
Installation & Setup
1. Unpack the downloaded module into the ATutor mods directory. This will create an payments/ directory which contains all the module files.

2. As the ATutor administrator, under the Modules tab choose Install Module, and choose the Payments module from the list of available modules. If you do not see the module available, make sure you have unpacked it into to right place ( /ATutor/mods/ecomm/)

3. After installed, on the main admin modules screen enable the module.

4. Once enabled, go to the admin's Payments tab and enter the Test/Sandbox information listed above into the appropriate fields, along with the currency and curreny symbol, and save those setting.

5.Optionally, the admin can enter a mailing address to which cheques can be sent and an an invoice generated, if that is to be one of the payment methods. Leave this field empty to disabled cheques as a method of payment.

6. Optionally, the admin can allow instructors to manage their own payments by selecting the associated checkbox in the payment	 settings.

7. Optionally, the administrator can receive an email notification when new payments are made by selecting  the associated checkbox in the payments settings


How the module works
Payments are course fees associated with an enrollment in a Private course. When a student attempts to enroll in a private course that has a fee associated with it, an entry will be added to the student's Payments screen, accessed through a tab in My Start Page. If the student clicks on Make Payment, and confirms the information as correct, they are redirectled to the secure payment site, where they enter their visa or master card number (availability of either depending on what the merchant account supports), and submit the payment. Just before being redirected to the secure site the information entered by the student is stored in the ec_shop table in ATutor, and it is updated when the payment service has confirmed the payment. Payments that have been completed will be updated with a confirmation code from the payment gateway. 

If the course has been set to auto-enroll students, they will immediately be given access to the course. If manual enrollment is set, they will receive a notice of their pending enrolment, which the instructor, or administrator must approve. This is useful when all students enrolled in a course are granted access at the same time.

Administrators can manage individual course payments and course payment settings as described for instrutors below, through the Course Payment Setting tab.

If instructors are allowed to manage their own payments, set by the administrator in step 6 above, they can access Payments through the Manage screen, where they can set the price for the course, and set whether to auto-enroll students, and whether to send an email to the instructor when a payment has been received. These settings are saved in the ec_course_fees table.

To make a payment students must first click on Enroll Me in the Browse Course listing. They are then instructed to make their payment to complete the enrolment. Or under the Payments Tab, they can click on Make Payment next to the course that is pending enrollment.
